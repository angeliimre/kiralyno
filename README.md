# About the project
In this project I made a react game. It is about how can you put 8 queens on a chessboard, without attacking each other<br/>
All of them must be in other row, other column, and other diagonal<br/>
After clicking on the chessboard an "X" will appear on the selected field of the board. After clicking again, you can take it back<br/>
If you make a mistake, the appropriate message will appear
